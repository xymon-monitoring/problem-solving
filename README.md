This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) so far (as this whole organisation/repo), that just tries to help Xymon 
- See "Goals of this repo" and "Remarks" below


### Xymon problems/issues
- [Summary: All problems status](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All the problems which are detailed](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)

### Goals of this repo
- To **inventory** and summary some problems
  -  **That do not fit well in any other repos**
  -  **That are long discussions on the mailing lists that need to be consolidated**
  -  **That are not in any other place so far** (No duplicates)
- To have an efficient collaborative and a follow up tool
- (Content: no files, no codes, just issues)

### How
- By having **a place for all such problems**, accessible by anyone
  - **Directly editable** by any member: **Colaborative** and efficient: anyone can correct anything that is wrong (no need to make a PR!)
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: strike-through the text (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and add the one you want.  
  - Github issues have an history: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistake 
- By making a **Summary** of problems 
   - **To reach quickly the essential** 
   - Structured, organized
     - Each list correspond to a category of problems
     - Split a category in 2, if it has more than 10 elements 
     - Try to order by priority or importance
- Recurrent work: create specific issues, refine issues, create issue, delete closed issues (list), consolidate information
- A checkbox is used to say that "there is nothing more to do in the summary" for this issue 
  - This the case if a specific issue is created
  - Can be changed in the near future as: I like it, but it is not very usefull: would like to try a more usefull meaning
 
### Remarks
- Idea of this repo was copied from other development teams that have to manage "Problems that do not fit well in other repos" 
- This Github organization is not official in the Xymon Ecosystem
- Content is based on the current (2023) Mailman mailing list, but is not validated by a Xymon admins or partially only
- Seems to me a need for some guide lines to match what the project/admin team expect: How to help resolving problem etc...
