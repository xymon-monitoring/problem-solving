### Xymon problems/issues
- [Summary: A digest of the main priorities and lists of problems with their status](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [Repository of all the problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)

 Note: 
 - This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) ([Is this tool a good idea?](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/17))
 - It can disapear without notice!

### Goals: a backlog tool
- **Inventory problems** and recurrent questions 
  - **That do not fit well in other repositories** 
  - **That are long discussions on the mailing lists that need to be consolidated** 
  - **That are not elsewere so far**
    - Always prefer the correct repository to avoid duplicates, but can be used in case of difficulties with it
- Help **focus on the main, most blocking problems**
  - Order by priority or importance
- Have a tracking tool
  - Who take care ?
  - What is the status ?

### How
- **Anyone** can participate!
  - By **adding** problems or **commenting** on existing problems
  - Try to make only one comment: If you want to add something add it to your previous comment (as it helps to keep things short and dense)
  - Github issues have an history: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistak
  - Your contibution will be review, consolidated and added to the main description: if you think the maintainer missed/misunderstood something: let us know!
- **Members** can **directly edit** anything and correct what is wrong
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: strike through the text (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and add the one you want.  
- **Admins** of this tool **help in finding solutions** to resolve problems
  - They take care of the community and its volunteers (rules, CoC ?)
  - They assign people with their consent to problems 
- **Maintainers** maintain the tool (what is not maintain by others)
  - Triage and consolidate information: No duplicates, ...
  - Structure and organize information: Keep things simple, readable, ...
