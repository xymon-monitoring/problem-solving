- [Summary of all the problems and their status](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All the problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)

### Context 2023: a need to move forward
- People are asking if Xymon is still alive, what is the future ? 
- People need to renew their tools: They Need to have some argument to stay with Xymon
  - They usuallly love it, but need also "moderm" features
- People are willing to help "moving forward", but are not easily able to

### Goals
- To **inventory** and **manage status** of problems (related to the curent context, but not only)
  -  **That do not fit well in other repos**
  -  **That are long discussions on the mailing lists that need to be consolidated** 
  -  **That are not in any other place so far** (No duplicates)
- To have an  **colaborative, efficient and simple** follow up tool


### How
- Members can **directly edit** anything, correct what is wrong
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: strike-through the text (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and add the one you want.  
- Guests can **add issue**
- Admins of this tool **help in finding solutions** to resolve problems
  - They take care of the community and its volunteers
  - They assign people with their consentement to problems 
- Maintainers do **summary** of problems: **to help reaching quickly the essential** 
  - Do a **digest** and **categorized lists of problems** 
  - Follow guide lines to keep thing simple:
    - Split a category in 2, if it has more than 10 elements 
    - Try to order by priority or importance
  - Do recurrent work: create specific issues, refine issues, create issue, delete closed issues (list), consolidate information
- Github issues have an history: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistake 
- The repo is the tool (and is dedicated only for that: no files, no codes, just issues)
