This is a POC so far, that just tries to help Xymon 
- See "Goals of this repo" and "Remarks" below


### Xymon problems
- [Summary of problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)

### Goals of this repo
- To inventory and summary some problems  
  -  **That do not fit well in any other repos**
  -  **There is a need to consolidate long discussions on the mailing lists as it is not easy to follow them**
  -  **That are not in any other place so far** (No duplicate)
- To have an efficient collaborative and a follow up tool
- Content: no files (so no code), just issues

### How
- By listing problems and orginized them in a **the summary**
- By having **a place for all such issues**, accessible by anyone
  - **Directly editable** by any member, so anyone can correct anything that is wrong (no need to make a PR!)
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: **strike-through the text** (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and **add the one you want**.  
  - Github issues **have an history**: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistake 
- By organizing the summary into lists of problems
   - Each list correspond to a category of problems
   - Split a category in 2, if it has more than 10 elements 
   - Try to order by priority or importance
- Recurrent work: create a specific issues, refine issues, add new issue, remove closed issue (list), consolidate info
- A checkbox is used to say that "there is nothing more to do in the summary" for this Issue 
  - This the case if there is a Ref to a specific issue 
  - Can be changed in the near future as: I like it, but it is not very usefull: would like to try a more usefull meaning
 
### Remarks
- Idea of this repo was copied from other dev teams that have to manage "Problems that do not fit weel in other repos" 
- This Github organization is not official in the Xymon Ecosystem
- Content is based on the current (2023) Mailman mailing list, but is not validated by a Xymon admins or partially only
- Seem to me also a need for guide lines to resolve problems to be as efficient as possible, something like (but I am not an expert in managing project)
  - Define specifications
    - Goals
    - Prerequisits
    - Potenetial problems
    - Solution evaluation methode
  - Look for solutions
    - Search for solutions that meet specification (most of them)
    - Compare
  - Choose
  - Implement
  - Document
  - Maintain
