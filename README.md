This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) so far (as this whole organisation/repo), that just tries to help Xymon 

### Xymon problems/issues
- [Summary of all the problems and their status](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All the problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)

### Goals of this repo
- To **inventory** and summary some problems
  -  **That do not fit well in any other repos**
  -  **That are long discussions on the mailing lists that need to be consolidated**
  -  **That are not in any other place so far** (No duplicates)
- To have an  **colaborative, efficient and simple** follow up tool
- (Content: no files, no codes, just issues)

### How
- Members can **directly edit** anything, correct what is wrong
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: strike-through the text (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and add the one you want.  
- Guests can **add issue** 
- Maintainer is making a **summary** of problems: **to reach quickly the essential** 
   - A **Digest** and **categorized lists of problems** 
   - Structured, organized ad simple. Guide lines:
     - Split a category in 2, if it has more than 10 elements 
     - Try to order by priority or importance
- Recurrent work to do: create specific issues, refine issues, create issue, delete closed issues (list), consolidate information
- Github issues have an history: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistake
