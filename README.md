### Ressources
- [Summary](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All issues](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)

### Goal
- Inventory all problems
  -  That do not fit well in any other repos
  -  That are not in any other place so far
- Starting point to follow any problema

### How
- By listing problems and orginized them
- By letting anyone create new problem
- By creating a list for each category of problems
- A checkbox is use to say that "there is nothing more to do in the summary" for this Issue (can change in the future)
  - As it is just a ref to another issue/document  
  - As the issue is really fully documented and/or the problem is resolved
- Split a list if it has more than 10 elements 
- Try to order by priority
- Recurrent work: create a new specific issue, refine the issue, add new issue, remove closed issue, consolidate info
