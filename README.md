### Xymon problems/issues
- [Summary of all the problems and their status](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All the problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)


### Goals: a backlog tool
- **Inventory the problems** 
  -  **That do not fit well in other repositories**
  -  **That are long discussions on the mailing lists that need to be consolidated** 
  -  **That are not elsewere so far** (No duplicates)
- Help **focus on the main, most blocking problems**
  - Order by priority or importance
- Have a tracking tool
  - Who take care
  - Status

### How
- **Anyone** can participate! **Adding problems** or **commenting** on problems
  - Do what you can, even you are not sure its is the best way to do it
  - Don't be afraid, the maintainer will consolidate : if you think I missed/misunderstood something, just tell me!
  - Try to make only one comment: If you want to add something add it to your previous comment (as it helps to keep things short and dense) 
- **Members** can **directly edit** anything and correct what is wrong
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: strike through the text (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and add the one you want.  
- **Admins** of this tool **help in finding solutions** to resolve problems
  - They take care of the community and its volunteers (rules, CoC ?)
  - They assign people with their consent to problems 
- **Maintainers** do the **summary** of problems: **to quickly reach the essential** 
  - Do a **digest** that focuses on the main problems
  - Do **categorized lists of problems** that structure all problems
  - Be neutral (try to be: do not push their ideas, do not remove ideas from others,... )
  - Follow guidelines to keep things simple 
    - Split a category in 2, if it has more than 10 elements 
    - Try to order by priority or importance
  - Do recurrent work: create specific issues, refine issues, create issues, delete/closed issues (list), consolidate information
- Github issues have an history: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistake 
- The whole repository is the tool (and is dedicated only for that: no files, no codes, just issues)

 Note: This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) ([Is this tool a good idea?](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/17)): It can disapear without notice!
