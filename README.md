This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) of a tool ([Is this tool a good idea?](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/17)) that can disapear without notice!



### Xymon problems/issues
- [Summary of all the problems and their status](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues/1)
- [All the problems](https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/problem-solving/issues)


### Goals
- To **inventory** and **manage status** of problems (related to the current context, but not only)
  -  **That do not fit well in other repos**
  -  **That are long discussions on the mailing lists that need to be consolidated** 
  -  **That are not in any other place so far** (No duplicates)
- To have an  **colaborative, efficient and simple** follow up tool
- Have the **ability to focus on the main, most blocking problems**

### How
- **Anyone** can participate! **adding problems** or **comment** other problems
  - Do what you can, even you are not sure its is the best way to do it
  - Don't be afraid, the maintainer will consolidate : if you think I miss/missundestand something, just tell me!
  - Try to make 1 comment only: If you want to add something add it to your previous comment (has it helps to keep thing short and dense) 
- **Members** can **directly edit** anything and correct what is wrong
  - If you want to correct something but you are not sure: strike-through the text (like \~\~text\~\~) that you want to replace and add the one you want.  
- **Admins** of this tool **help in finding solutions** to resolve problems
  - They take care of the community and its volunteers (rules, CoC ?)
  - They assign people with their consentement to problems 
- **Maintainers** do the **summary** of problems: **to reach quickly the essential** 
  - Do a **digest** that focus on the main problems
  - Do **categorized lists of problems** that structure all problems
  - Is neutral (try to be: do not push its ideas, do not remove ideas from others,.. )
  - Follow guide lines to keep thing simple:
    - Split a category in 2, if it has more than 10 elements 
    - Try to order by priority or importance
  - Do recurrent work: create specific issues, refine issues, create issue, delete closed issues (list), consolidate information
- Github issues have an history: (click on "edited" at the top) to revert a mistake 
- The repo is the tool (and is dedicated only for that: no files, no codes, just issues)
